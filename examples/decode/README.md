# Example: Encode and Decode a Fixed String

This example demonstrates the usage of `basexform_encode` and `basexform_decode` resources to encode and then decode a fixed string value.

## Usage

The example first encodes a predefined value (`"123456789012"`) into base 36 and then decodes it back to its original format.

Outputs include the original value, the encoded value, the decoded value, and the difference in length between the original and encoded values.
